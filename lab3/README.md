# TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach

This repository includes the exercises in the textbook [TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Essentials-Lab-Based-Approach/dp/052160124X), adapted to use the GENI testbed rather than an in-house lab.

### ARP, Bridges and LANs

Unlike some other lab exercises, for this lab, the instructions do *not* include interspersed notes about what you will need to include/answer in your lab report. Instead, those instructions are listed at the end of the page in an "Exercise" section. Before you start each section, you should carefully read the associated part of the exercise at the end, and the notes below, so that you know what output to save and what questions you will need to answer.

* [ARP exercises](3-arp.md)

* [Operation of a basic Ethernet switch or bridge](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/). Note the questions that you will have to answer after some sections:
  * When you complete the [Set up the bridge](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#setupthebridge) section, answer the first question in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#exercise) section.
  * When you complete the [Learning MAC addresses](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#learningmacaddresses) section, answer the second question in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#exercise) section.
  * There is a question about the [Effect of a smaller collision domain](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#effectofasmallercollisiondomain) section, in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#exercise) section. However, you do *not* have to answer this question.

* [Additional questions on bridge operation](3-5-simple-bridge.md) (This uses the same topology as "Operation of a basic Ethernet switch or bridge", so don't delete your resources until you finish this section.)
* [Spanning tree protocol](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/).  Note the questions that you will have to answer after some sections:
  * When you complete the [Create a broadcast storm](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#createabroadcaststorm) section, answer the first question in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#exercise) section.
  * When you complete the [Set up bridges to use spanning tree algorithm](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#setupbridgestousespanningtreealgorithm) section, answer the second question in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#exercise) section. You can use [this template](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=spanning-tree-template.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgsathish%2Ftcp-ip-essentials%2Fmaster%2Flab3%2Fspanning-tree-template.drawio) to create the spanning tree diagram.
  * When you complete the [Reacting to changes in the topology](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#reactingtochangesinthetopology) section, answer the third and fourth questions in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#exercise) section.
