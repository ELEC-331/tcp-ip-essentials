# TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach

This repository includes the exercises in the textbook [TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Essentials-Lab-Based-Approach/dp/052160124X), adapted to use the GENI testbed rather than an in-house lab.

### TCP study

* [TCP sockets and the TCP state diagram](el5373-lab6-6x.md)
* [TCP bulk file transfer](el5373-lab6-6y.md)
* [TCP congestion control](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/tcp-congestion-control-basics/) (note: the topology in this experiment is the same as in the previous experiments, so you don't need to reserve new resources.)
