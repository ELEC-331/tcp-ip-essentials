# TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach

This repository includes the exercises in the textbook [TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Essentials-Lab-Based-Approach/dp/052160124X), adapted to use the GENI testbed rather than an in-house lab.


### The Web, DHCP, NTP and NAT

Unlike some other lab exercises, for this lab, the instructions do not include interspersed notes about what you will need to include/answer in your lab report. Instead, those instructions are listed at the end of the page in an "Exercise" section. Before you start each section, you should carefully read the associated part of the exercise at the end, so that you know what output to save and what questions you will need to answer.

You will use the same topology for all three parts of this exercise, so don't delete your resources until you have finished all of it!
